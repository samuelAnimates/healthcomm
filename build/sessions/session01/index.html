    <h2>Script for: "Session 01 (Picnic)"</h2>
    <p><h3>Introduction ( 5 minutes)</h3>
<p>Before we really dive in, I'd like to start off by welcoming everyone, telling you a bit about myself, and giving a quick outline of how this class works.</p>
<p>So first: welcome everyone. It's nice to see you all. And I'm not just saying that because it's written here.</p>
<p>And second: about me...</p>
<p>And finally: this is how the class works. We'll start each class the same way. We'll remind ourselves of the main goals of this class and the learning objectives for this specific session. And we'll go over the community standards of this class before diving in.</p>
<p>The main goal of this class is to work with the aspects of health communication that go beyond the transfer of information. And we'll aim to have fun while doing so. The learning objectives for todays session are:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a working understanding of the difference between &quot;transmission&quot; and &quot;ritual&quot; views of communication</li>
<li>describe an example of a &quot;ritual&quot; aspect of communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today will be a mix of facilitation from me, small group design activities, and large group discussion. I will mostly stick to this script on-screen when I'm in facilitation mode. I find it helpful for focus and as a backup in case my sound goes in and out or you're in a loud place.</p>
<h3>Community Standards: Picnic Edition (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>If it helps to set the mood, you  can imagine we're here together on Chicago's Oak Street Beach on a mild summer day with waves lapping at the shore. If you listen carefully, you can hear the beach, but maybe not because of Zoom audio filters.</p>
<p>Here are a few community standards for this weird online beach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>W.A.I.T.</strong> means &quot;Why am I talking?&quot; and &quot;Why aren't I talking?&quot; We're all here as a group, and we'll benefit the most if people get an equal shot at sharing their ideas. If you find yourself speaking up a lot, stop and <strong>W.A.I.T.</strong> If you find yourslef not speaking up much, stop and <strong>W.A.I.T.</strong> as reminder to switch things up.</li>
<li>Don't assume what pronouns someone uses. We'll introduce ourselves with our pronouns. If you forget, then ask. Feel free to rename yourself on Zoom to include your pronouns. I will not be afraid to jump in if someone makes a mistake, and I invite everyone else to remind people if they need it as well.</li>
<li>Do not record, screencap, or otherwise share other people's stories from this class. We'll talk about health topics, and people might bring up their own experiences. We want to honor that openness with respect for privacy.</li>
<li>I will not record any part of this lecture. That said, we will make things together, and I'll ask explicitly if it's okay to put some of this class's outputs online without using any names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Introductions (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>To get this event started I want to thank you all for coming to my picnic. You had effectively infinite options of things to do right now, and you chose to be here. So, I'd like to celebrate by setting the stage a little more. I'll do the first introduction and call on the next person, and we'll go ina  circle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Pronouns</li>
<li>What you would bring to a picnic</li>
<li>Name the next person for a self-introduction</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Game of Telephone: Step 1 (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>For today's session, we're going to play a game of telephone, broken up into a couple steps. I will break you up into small groups and give each group their own link to a Google Slide presentation to work in.</p>
<p>I will walk through an example first. For step 1, you will describe the relationships between people in the kind of context pictured on the slide. Then you'll delete the slide and the instructions. Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQbFhGQ9MUnd66iKDoezl42wu9soOjbPug1BbOcIBWWmJQGI9kTcqV0zKq0cXjlbu61NhzRaPa_6KrD/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">an example of step 1</a>.</p>
<h3>Ritual and Transmission (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>What we just did was an exercise involving the ritual view of communication. I'll explain what that means, and then you'll have a chance to revisit what you just did.</p>
<p>A transmission view of communication focuses on the information that gets from A to B. A transmission view of communication supposes that the flow of information is the important part of communication. For example, in a transmission view of communication, a newspaper gives information about fish that influences the reader to like eating fish.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50823094708_a8985f3bb1_k.jpg" alt="Transmission Communication: a newspaper gives information to someone, which influences their worldviews" style="border: black solid 2px; width:100%;" /></p>
<p>A ritual view of communication  instead focuses on the relationships and social structures formed. It supposes that the important part of communication relates to power and social roles. For example, in a ritual view of communication, a newspaper gives information about fish that signals to the reader that this is a newspaper for fish lovers, who are numerous enough to be catered to in a newspaper.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50823931477_f290990eaa_k.jpg" alt="Ritual Communication" style="border: black solid 2px; width:100%;" /></p>
<p>A ritual view of communication asks: what bonds does communication help form? Who has power? Who has authority? How does communication impose rules for the people involved? How does communication signal to people that they belong to a larger community?</p>
<p>With these kinds of questions in mind, you'll have a few more minutes to revisit your group's slides from earlier. Any questions before we dive back in?</p>
<h3>A Game of Telephone: Step 2 (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>I will take a moment to swap around some links. Each group will get a link to another Slides presentation. You'll see the description of the kinds of relationships formed in a specific context. Then you'll try to come up with a health-related situation that matches as many of the bullet points as possible. You'll mark which bullet points you were able to match. Lastly, you'll add in a photo to illustrate the situation.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17qNUz44ilLefNYnfOCbz98fcEzwBbZe98jy_XlnSluI/edit?usp=sharing">an example of step 2</a></p>
<h3>Large Group Discussion (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>Now I'll facilitate a discussion around the slides you just made. For each group's creation, we'll first begin with some guesses about what the original photo was of. Then we'll explore the links between the health scenario and the original photo, in relation to today's learning objectives.</p>
